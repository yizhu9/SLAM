This project only contains three documents.

The utils.py and hw3_main.py is the given file.

The file I wrote is main.py, it does prediction first and doing the combination of mapping and updating for the pose.

You can just change the file name to apply it to different records.

The parameter which could be changed is the W(covariance of prediction noise), V (covariance of observation noise)and cov(initial covariance).
